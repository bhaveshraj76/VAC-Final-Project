# VAC-Final-Project

This Project is made to predict the revenue of the movies from the database available

We have used Simple Linear Regression And Multiple Linear Regression to complete this project

Summary of the Project:

Step-1 : Got the dataset from github "tmdb_5000_movies" and imported the dataset into our project.

Step-2 : Done Some cleaning process for the Analysis and selected the important fields for the process.

Step-3 : Imported the libraries "caTools" and "caret"

Step-4 : Sliced the dataset in the process for "Simple Linear Regression".

Step-6 : Splitted the dataset for train_set and test_set.

Step-7 : Used the Linear regression model for "Simple Linear Regression" and "Multiple Linear Regression".

Step-8 : Prediction was done using the regression model generated.

Step-9 : Output is compared with test_set.

Step-10 : Visualization and errors informations where gathered from the above process.

Step-11 : End
